## About Us

Divine Heart Beats was born from a divine calling on **October 4, 2025**, when a group of passionate Christian musicians from the Dallas-Fort Worth area came together with a shared vision: to use the gift of music for evangelization and to sing for the glory of God.

### Our Mission
We are called to spread the Gospel through the power of music, touching hearts and souls across the DFW area and beyond. Our songs are not just melodies—they are messages of hope, faith, and God's eternal love.

### Our Foundation
Our ministry is built upon the solid foundation of Scripture, particularly **Colossians 3:16**. This verse encapsulates everything we stand for—allowing Christ's message to flow through our music, teaching and encouraging others, and singing with grateful hearts.
